## Features / Guide

### The Archetypes menu

The plugin adds a new subcategory to the Parameters menu (Heart Icon), where you can toggle which parts you want to save to your favorites or recombine to create a new character. There is also an advanced menu option for renaming your favorite parts, saving your favorites to disk for later use, and much more.


### The Quick Controls menu

In the Load Character and Load Outfit menu screens, you will find a Quick Access menu to the right side where you can quickly add items to your favorite list from the selected cards. The "Jump to Next" option even increments the selected card for you, to make it easier to add a lot of cards to your favorites collection. Outfits, with accessories, can be added from either Character cards or Coordinate cards. Or you could always add items from your current character from the Archetype submenu instead.


### Recombining new characters

When you have added enough parts to your favorite list, you can at any point recombine your favorite parts to a new character by going to the Archetype submenu, checking the parts you want to randomize, and click add parts. If you want to add a specific part, you can find all the parts you have added to your list in the Advanced Controls menu.
